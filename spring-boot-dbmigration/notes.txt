Assume you wish to move your database to a different environment.

For instance, suppose you have a database in the SIT environment that you want to transfer to the data toÂ SIT2 environment.
The legacy way to do that is :
Creating scripts for each database change, storing them in a file, then firing them in the environment you wish to migrate to is the traditional way to do it.

This is time consuming and prone to errors.

Even if the change is small, you must manually run the scripts every time a database modification is made.

Also, if a change has been made, make sure you only execute the new scripts and not the old ones (accidentally).

There is a solution, and it is fully automated!

All you have to do now is place your scripts in a folder with version number and 
the latest version will be automatically executed when your spring boot application starts!

The tool which does this is called flywaydb
link : https://flywaydb.org/

Use this as an example project to understand how flywaydb works :-)

Configurations required before running this project:
create a database migrateDB.
update the configs in application.properties file as needed

After running this project, schema, table creation and data insertion.
Also version updation in public schema -> schema_version table
